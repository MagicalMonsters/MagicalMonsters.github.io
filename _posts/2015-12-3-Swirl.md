title: Swirl (prototype)

This is our first game with Unity and we spent more time than we expected on unity to get it to do what we wanted. You control two handles to guide a ball to a small hole in the center of the scene to proceed to next level.


It is very primitive since we focused on gameplay and mechanics.
Hope that you enjoy playing it!
