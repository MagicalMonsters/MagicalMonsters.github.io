title: Swirl (prototype)
---

This is our first game with Unity and we spent more time on it than we expected. You control a ball using two handles. To proceed to the next level you need to guide the ball into a hole in the center of the scene. In different levels, there may be some requirements for the hole to appear. For each level, time is limited (100 seconds).


It is very primitive since we focused mainly on gameplay and mechanics.
Hope that you enjoy playing it!
