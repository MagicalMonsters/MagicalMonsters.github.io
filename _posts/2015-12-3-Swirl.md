title: Swirl (prototype)

This is our first game with Unity and we spent more time on it than we expected. You control two handles to guide a ball into a small hole in the center of the scene to proceed to the next level.


It is very primitive since we focused mainly on gameplay and mechanics.
Hope that you enjoy playing it!
