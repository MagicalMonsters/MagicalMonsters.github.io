title: Swirl (prototype)
---

Swirl is our first game (more of a prototype, actually) with Unity. Both of us are programmer but we were not familiar with Unity3d, so this was our introduction to Unity. We spent more time that we expected on Swirl, probably due to the fact that this was our first encounter with Unity3D and our C# knowledge was a little rusty as well. 

It is a very simple 2D game. The user controls two handles to guide a ball into a black hole in the center to proceed to the next level while having 100 seconds to finish each level. 
It consists of 9 levels, each introducing a new mechanism in the game and it becomes harder as you proceed.
In some levels, there may be some requirements for the hole to appear.

For Swirl we focused on gameplay and game design. Testing different ideas and choosing the one's that worked the best, we tried to make it challenging yet enjoyable. 

We hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoyed making it!
