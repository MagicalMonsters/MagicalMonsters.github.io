title: TwinSkaters (prototype)
---

TwinSkaters is our second game prototype with Unity which is a vertically scrolling game.

The player can control two skateboards simultaneously. There are 4 functions for the movement of the skateboards. Left and right arrow keys will move skateboards to the left or the right as you can expect from a vertically scrolling game. Holding the up arrow key will move the skateboards far from eachother and holding the down arrow key the other way. As a result there is a full control over the movement of skateboards.

The game will be over after hitting an obstacle. Your score will be calculated based on the time you survived in the game as well as the number of stars you gathered.

Hope you enjoy it ;)
