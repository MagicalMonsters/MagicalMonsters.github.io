title: 2D platformer

I was wandering around youtube a few days ago and found a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPiCgCkHTE&index=1&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR42oVBU6K2DIL6Y22Ry9J1c) on how to make 2D platformer games in unity; and I was thinking it's a good idea. So I started following the contents and here is what I have done till now.
