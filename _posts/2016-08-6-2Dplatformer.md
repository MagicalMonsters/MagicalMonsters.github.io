title: 2D platformer

I was wandering around youtube a few days ago and found a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbPiCgCkHTE&index=1&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR42oVBU6K2DIL6Y22Ry9J1c) on how to make 2D platformer games in unity; and I was thinking it's a good idea. So I am following the videos and I am at episod 7 of the videos. Till now I've done some pralaxing and tiling for the background.

At this moment I am thinking about the possible mechanics I can add to the game to make it some kind of unique. And the first think after ward would be some level design to try the mechanics in action.
